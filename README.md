# Statistics Project
## MultiLinear Regression 
This project presents an analysis of cancer data using Multiple Linear Regression. The paper outlines the methodology of implementing Multilinear Regression to analyze death rates based on cancer data. It covers various stages including descriptive statistics and visualization, outlier handling, feature selection, and implementation of the regression model. The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, and Sci-kit learn for data analysis and modeling.
## Logistic Regression 
The logistic regression model aims to accurately classify individuals as either having diabetes or not based on features such as gender, age, blood glucose levels, cholesterol levels, and body mass index (BMI). The model is trained on the provided dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
## Time Series Forecasting
The project of time series forecasting methods employed in a study on temperature data analysis. The study explores the application of Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models for forecasting temperature trends.
